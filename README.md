## The Packedoo Android Application

This Android application was developed for the startup company 'Packedoo' and was built using Flutter in 2019.

At the time of development, Flutter was still in its early stages, undergoing frequent updates, bug fixes, and the availability of many plugins was limited to pre-release versions.

Despite these challenges, the experience of working with Flutter was truly remarkable. It greatly accelerated the development process and enhanced overall convenience.

The app is still available on the Google Play Store via link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=qroog.packedoo.android, though the project is no longer maintained.
